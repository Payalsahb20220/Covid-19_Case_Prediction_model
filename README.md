COVID-19 Time Series Analysis and Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the daily new COVID-19 cases using Autoregressive (AR) modeling. It aims to provide insights into the trends and patterns of the pandemic, as well as forecast future case numbers.

The project includes the following key components:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   - Visualizing the time series data of daily new COVID-19 cases
   - Computing autocorrelation coefficients and lagged sequences
   
2. Autoregressive (AR) Modeling:
   - Implementing AR model to forecast future new cases
   - Training the AR model with the given data
   - Evaluating the model's performance using RMSE and MAPE
   
3. Lag Analysis:
   - Experimenting with different lag values in the AR model
   - Analyzing the impact of lag on prediction accuracy
   
4. Peak Detection:
   - Identifying the peak in the predicted new cases
   - Determining the corresponding date and value of the peak
   
The project provides a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 cases, showcases the use of AR modeling for time series prediction, and offers insights into peak detection. It can be a valuable resource for researchers, data scientists, and anyone interested in understanding and forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic.

Dataset: The project utilizes a daily COVID-19 cases dataset, including the date and new cases count, sourced from reliable public health agencies.

Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, statsmodels, sklearn
